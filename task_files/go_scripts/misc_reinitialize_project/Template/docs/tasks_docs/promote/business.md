üöÄ **Introducing LibTracker: Simplifying Dependency Management in VSCode!** üöÄ

We‚Äôre excited to announce the latest updates to **LibTracker**, our streamlined SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) tool designed to make dependency management effortless. LibTracker now supports popular frameworks along with their Gradle, Kotlin Gradle, npm, pip, and venv equivalents for Java, Node.js, and Python applications.

With this release, we‚Äôve enhanced dependency tracking by incorporating the package manager as an additional field when adding apps to projects. We‚Äôve also developed a parser for **Gemfile** files, which we aim to extend for iOS **Podfiles**. This will contribute to a broader npm library for parsing Ruby dependency files.

**Now Available on the VSCode Marketplace:**
Access it here: [LibTracker on VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=windmillcode-publisher-0.lib-tracker).

### Next on Our Roadmap:
1. **App Dependency Page**
   - View licenses
   - View security vulnerabilities
   - CRUD for dependencies
   - (Possibly) identify unused packages

2. **Support for Code Workspaces**
   - Open entire projects as workspaces
   - Edit code-workspace files to include additional folders as needed

We‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and feedback as we continue to evolve LibTracker! #LibTracker #DependencyManagement #VSCodeExtensions #Windmillcode
